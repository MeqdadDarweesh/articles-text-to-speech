Convert the text of articles to speech using nltk, newspaper and gTTS with Python.

## What I did?

In this [code](text_to_speech.py), I've used Python with multiple libraries:

### nltk
_Natural Language Toolkit_, visit: https://www.nltk.org/

### gTTS
_Google Text-to-Speech_, a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API.
For more details, visit: https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### newspaper
_newspaper library_, visit: https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Output sample:

In this code example, I've used this article:
[Coronavirus: How can AI help fight the pandemic?](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51851292) from BBC News.

```
First 250 character of the article:

Executives from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook met officials at Downing Street on Wednesday to discuss their role in 
the coronavirus crisis
```
You can check the audio file as a result of this execution.
